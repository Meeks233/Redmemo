# Natural Prefetch (NP)

> **Discovery:** the NP sub list is the instance's public identity. With SEO on (the default — see [Configuration → SEO](Configuration.md#seo)) the chosen subs are advertised to search engines and aggregators via the archive hub, `/sitemap.xml`, and the machine-readable `/np.json` feed — the union of *archived* and *configured-but-not-yet-archived* subs — so people can find which self-hosted instance mirrors a given sub without a central directory.

NP is a producer/consumer pipeline that quietly fills the archive without burst patterns. All outbound traffic — both the L1 Reddit-API listing fetch and the L2 CDN media downloads — flows through one **NP dispatcher** goroutine that applies a 1–3 s random delay between calls and pauses 30 s after any user-triggered upstream request.

## Layers

| Layer | Trigger | Cost / round | Behaviour |
|-------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **L1** Shallow archive | One cycle per sub-timeframe bucket; cycle period = bucket base ± jitter; one fetch per sub per cycle, randomly spaced within the cycle | 1 Reddit API request per sub per cycle | Walks the sub's resolved listing (`/r/{sub}/{sort}.json?t=`) with `after` cursor. UPSERTs into `posts`, preserves `media_done`. Identifies new posts and hands them to L2. |
| **L2** Media archive | Runs immediately after each L1 fetch | 0 Reddit API requests (CDN only) | Pure cache acceleration. Sorts new posts newest-first, downloads image/video/gallery via CDN, marks `media_done = true`. Verifies files still exist on disk and re-downloads if evicted. The CDN is effectively unmetered, so L2 never spends OAuth budget and never gates L3. |
| **L3** Deep archive | Scheduled — one independent L3 cycle per L1 fetch for any sub whose depth covers comments (plus the on-demand post-handler path) | 1 Reddit API request per comment fetch | Self-standing comment layer. Decoupled from L1/L2 in the ledger: mints its **own** cycle id (`L3:<tf>:<sub>:<unix>`), supersedes its own lineage, and chooses work via `ListL3Candidates` (recent posts, freeze + min-comments + growth override) rather than L2's `media_done` queue. Shares the NP dispatcher + OAuth budget gate with L1 — the two API-budget layers jointly pace their requests. |
| **L4** Icon cache | Startup + every 1 h + on `/archive` view | 1 Reddit API request per sub when stale | Keeps `sub_icons` fresh (default TTL 30 days). Icon image itself is a CDN download. |

## Depth (which layers run per sub)

NP exposes a **depth** dimension on top of the L1 / L2 / L3 layer split: it controls whether each crawled sub also runs media downloads and/or comment fetches. Resolved per sub, override > global:

| Value | L1 (listings) | L2 (media cache) | L3 (comments) |
|-------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| `none` | yes | no | no |
| `l2`   | yes | yes | no |
| `l3`   | yes | no  | yes (independent L3 cycle) |
| `l2+l3` | yes | yes | yes (independent L3 cycle, in parallel with L2; default) |

L2 and L3 are independent: when a sub's depth covers both, the per-L1-fetch fan-out spawns an L2 media wave **and** a separate L3 comment cycle that run concurrently and never share a cycle key. L3 no longer rides L2's media-done queue, so text posts (the majority on discussion subs) get their comments archived just like media posts. Setting `depth:l2` turns comments off; `depth:l3` archives comments without touching the CDN.

### L3 wave dispersion (per-wave API cap)

Both layers disperse their waves across the cycle period with randomized offsets (`planWaveOffsets` — same stealth tempo for L2 and L3). They differ on both *how many* waves and the per-wave *volume*:

- **L2** chops the period into a fixed `l2WavesPerCycle` (5) waves sized against `l2WaveCap` (100). CDN downloads are effectively unmetered, so a wave may drain a large media chunk, and any overflow beyond 5×100 is left for the next cycle.
- **L3** sizes the *wave count* to the work instead of fixing it at 5: `planL3Waves` rolls `ceil(postCount / l3WaveTarget)` waves (`l3WaveTarget` = **5**, the desired average fetches per wave), clamped to `[1, l3MaxWaves]` (**64**), with each wave's chunk still drawn from a non-uniform partition but hard-capped at `l3WaveCap` (**10**). Because the count scales with `postCount`, the per-wave chunks **sum to the full `postCount`** — every candidate this round is scheduled and the whole batch lands before the next L1 fetch (e.g. a 93-post round → 19 waves; an ~80-post round → 16 waves). The `l3CycleChunksInvalid` invariant enforces both "chunks cover `postCount`" and "no wave > `l3WaveCap`". Only when `postCount` exceeds `l3MaxWaves × l3WaveCap` (640) does the tail genuinely roll into the next cycle (L3 re-walks recent posts each cycle, so it never has to drain everything at once). Every L3 fetch spends one real OAuth API request, so the per-wave cap bounds the worst-case burst while the offsets spread the firing across the full period.

- Global default: `prefetch_default_depth` (storage key) / `REDMEMO_DEFAULT_PREFETCH_DEFAULT_DEPTH` (env). The settings page renders it as the **Default depth** select on the NP fieldset.
- Per-sub override: append `depth:<value>` inside a prefetch override clause, e.g. `golang=depth:l2+l3&sort:top` or `rust=depth:none`. Override wins per-sub. Unknown values are dropped.
- Common pattern: set the global default to `none` and opt specific subs into media+comments via `<sub>=depth:l2+l3` — this is how the settings page documents single-sub deep crawls.

## Driving NP from /settings — the prefetch field

The entire crawl list lives in **one text box** on the settings page (Natural Prefetch → subreddits). It is a single `+`-separated stream where each clause is either:

- a **bare subreddit name** — `cats` — crawled with the global Default sort / timeframe / depth, or
- a **per-sub override clause** — `cats=sort:rising&time:day&depth:l2+l3` — the same sub crawled with its own sort / timeframe / depth.

```
field   := <clause>(+<clause>)*
clause  := <sub>                       # bare — inherit the global defaults
         | <sub>=<k>:<v>(&<k>:<v>)*     # override one or more dimensions for this sub
```

Recognised override keys (case-insensitive; unknown pieces are silently dropped):

| Key | Aliases | Values | Effect |
|-----|---------|--------|--------|
| `sort` | — | `hot` `new` `top` `rising` `controversial` | listing sort for this sub |
| `time` | `t`, `timeframe` | `hour` `day` `week` `month` `year` `all` | listing timeframe — also selects the cadence bucket (see below) |
| `depth` | `d` | `none` `l2` `l3` `l2+l3` | which layers run (see the Depth table above; `l1` / `off` are accepted as aliases for `none`) |

How clauses resolve:

- A clause overrides **only** the dimensions you name; anything you omit falls back to the global Default sort / timeframe / depth.
- Override clauses always **win over** the global defaults for that sub.
- The parser is **lenient**: an unknown key, a misspelled value, or a malformed `k:v` pair is dropped on its own without killing the rest of the clause. A clause that ends up with *no* usable override at all is dropped whole.
- **Duplicate sub names** collapse to the last occurrence.
- The `+` inside `depth:l2+l3` is understood as part of the value, not a clause separator.

Operators can seed the same content at boot: `REDMEMO_DEFAULT_PREFETCH_SUBS` (bare list), `REDMEMO_DEFAULT_PREFETCH_SUB_MODES` (override clauses), `REDMEMO_DEFAULT_PREFETCH_DEFAULT_DEPTH` (global depth).

### Examples

```
golang+rust+linux
```
Crawl three subs, all on the global defaults.

```
news=time:hour&sort:hot
```
Crawl r/news on the hourly cadence with hot sort; every other dimension stays at the default.

```
golang=depth:l2+l3&sort:top+rust=depth:none
```
r/golang gets full media + comments on top sort; r/rust fetches listings only (no media, no comments).

```
cats+dogs+golang=sort:rising&time:day+rust=depth:l2+l3&sort:top
```
Mixed list: cats and dogs on defaults; golang on rising/day; rust full-depth on top.

> Common pattern: set the global **Default depth** to `None` and opt individual subs into media/comments with `<sub>=depth:l2+l3` — cheap by default, deep only where you want it.

## Per-timeframe bucket cadence

L1 no longer runs a single global cycle. Each subreddit's resolved timeframe (per-sub `time:` clause in `prefetch_sub_modes`, else the global `prefetch_timeframe`, else `day`) maps it to one of six fixed-period buckets:

| Bucket | Base period | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `hour`  | 6 h    | Finest cadence — for fast-churn subs (news / live events) |
| `day`   | 12 h   | Default when no timeframe is configured |
| `week`  | 48 h   | |
| `month` | 15 days | |
| `year`  | 180 days | |
| `all`   | 365 days | Coldest — for archives that rarely change |

The bucket is read from the *raw* timeframe even when the sort doesn't honour it. A sub configured as `sort:hot&time:week` still fires on a weekly cadence — the timeframe is dropped only before it reaches the listing URL, not from the cadence decision.

Each bucket period is jittered by ±20 % each cycle, so the actual wall-clock between two cycles of the same bucket is roughly base × [0.80, 1.20]. Within one cycle, subs are shuffled into a fresh random order; each sub's sleep gap is the *remaining cycle budget* divided by *subs left*, then jittered again by ±20 %. The result is that two cycles of a Day bucket containing [a, b, c] might run as `[2.1 h: b, 5.4 h: a, 9.8 h: c]` then `[3.0 h: c, 4.6 h: a, 8.3 h: b]` — different order, different gaps, same nominal 12 h cadence.

The per-sub gap is floored at `minBucketGap` (30 s) so unlucky jitter can't squeeze two fetches into a dispatcher cooldown. The cycle period is floored at `gap × N` and at `minCyclePeriod` (1 min) so a misconfigured override can never produce a sub-second cycle.

   L3 (comments): self-standing scheduled layer — one independent L3
                  cycle spawned per L1 fetch (own cycle id, own ledger
                  lineage), plus the on-demand post-handler path. Shares
                  this dispatcher + OAuth budget gate with L1.
   L4 (icons):    independent hourly loop, sharing the dispatcher.
   L5 (audio):    drains once per L1 bucket cycle, after L2.
```

All bucket loops feed work items into the single NP dispatch queue, so the total outbound rate is still bounded by the dispatcher's per-call cooldown and the HR budget — no matter how many buckets are active at once.

### Reclaim respects the current depth

At startup the scheduler revives pending L2/L3 waves from `prefetch_runs` (the ledger survives container death; in-memory goroutines do not). The reclaim path is **depth-gated**: before reviving a group it checks `depthCoversLayer(layer, resolveSubDepth(sub))`. If the operator changed a sub's depth since those waves were scheduled — e.g. flipped it to `l3` (L2 off) — the leftover pending L2 rows are marked `skipped` ("depth no longer covers L2") and are **not** revived, their `/debug` cycle snapshot is not rebuilt, and the reclaim status is never set. Without this, an L3-only sub would show a phantom **"L2 recovering"** on `/debug` for the whole period, because each orphaned wave only skipped itself late (after sleeping to its `scheduled_at`). The same guard sits at the top of `driveReclaimedCycle` as a backstop.

One window the startup gates can't catch: a reclaim driver that already passed the gate (depth still covered L2 at boot) and is now **parked on a future wave** — its only further depth re-check fires at the top of the next wave iteration, so disabling the layer mid-sleep (deploy that flips `prefetch_default_depth`, or a `/settings` save) would leave the banner + rebuilt cycle snapshot stranded until the wave finally wakes and skips itself. To close it, `Status()` applies a **render-time depth gate**: it re-resolves each recovering sub's current depth and drops both the `"recovering"` banner (`reclaimL{2,3}Sub`) and any cycle panel (`snapshotCoveredCycles`) for a layer the depth no longer covers, so `/debug` always reflects current settings regardless of in-flight reclaim goroutines.

Cursors persist per-bucket (`_prefetch_bucket_state_<tf>`) and per `(sub, sort, t)` key. They advance through a sub's listing across cycles; when a cursor exhausts within a cycle, the bucket clears the per-cycle exhaustion map and re-walks from the head on the next cycle so new "hot" / "top" content is still captured.
